## IntakeWatch

**IntakeWatch** is an app designed for people with dietary restrictions and allergic conditions. Whether you follow a diet for personal or medical reasons, finding options to eat and tracking your health at the same time can be challenging. 

The app was specifically developed for people on elimination diets that struggle with conditions such as **EoE** (eosinophilic esophagitis), **IBS** (Irritable bowel syndrome), skin conditions (**eczema**), **ADHD**, **migraines**, and much more. Narrowing down on your food triggers while on an elimination diet can get confusing and hard to track, and as a person with EoE, I developed **IntakeWatch** with people suffering from similar conditions in mind.

- **IntakeWatch** serves to solve these challenge by scanning product barcodes and analyzing pictures of ingredients lists to find your allergens.
- You can choose your own allergens from the main 8 food allergen groups while also creating your own specific allergens that IntakeWatch watches for. 
- Use the Food Diary in order to track your meals and any medical symptoms you may be experiencing during your diet.
- Analytics help you understand your triggers and what foods/ingredients you eat before experiencing certain symptoms in a concise and easily comprehensible format.

### Background

Hi! I'm Dakshin Devanand, a 17 year old living in Frisco, Texas, and I developed **IntakeWatch** by myself over the past couple months. After I was diagnosed with Eosinophilic Esophagitis a couple years ago, I started a elimination diet where I cut out wheat, dairy, and nuts. To say the least, eating was a struggle. And as an already underweight kid, my health was declining. As I started learning app development, I had the idea to make a project that helped myself and people with allergies and similar conditions to EoE. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have EoE or are on an elimination diet, I would love to discuss about it and about any thoughts you had on the app.
